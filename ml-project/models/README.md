# This file provides documentation about the saved models and checkpoints, including information on how to load and use them.

# Models Directory Documentation

## Overview
The `models` directory contains saved machine learning models and checkpoints that have been trained during the project. These models can be used for making predictions or further fine-tuning.

## Saved Models
- **Model Name**: Description of the model, including its architecture and purpose.
- **Checkpoint Files**: Information on the checkpoint files, including how to load them and the training state they represent.

## Loading Models
To load a saved model, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
import joblib

model = joblib.load('path/to/saved_model.pkl')
```

## Usage
Once loaded, the model can be used to make predictions on new data:

```python
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the environment matches the one used during training for compatibility.
- Refer to the specific model documentation for any additional requirements or dependencies.
